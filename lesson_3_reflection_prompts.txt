When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to share my work with others.
    When there are multiple people working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Someone might push something that would break what I'm doing (conflicts) without knowing it and I can't finish my work if I have to keep up with those changes.
    To pull changes manually allows finishing local implementations first and dealing with ongoing changes later.
